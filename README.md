# Software-project-for-bakery-Java-swing-and-MySql-

The following software is a personal project to implement my learnings of software engineering, system analysis and desighn, DBMS using MySql, Java and Java GUI using Swing. It is basically a software system to be used for a bakery shop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sofware used to develop the project :-

1. MS Office package (Word and powerpoint for project writeup and presentation).
2. Gnatt project for Gnatt chart of the project.
3. Microsoft visio for diagrams (DFD, ERD, FDD, Use Case Diagram etc).
4. MySql server and MySql workbench for Database and model desighn (Back end).
5. JDK and Netbeans for Java Forms (Front end).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionalities :-

1. Add, remove, update the menu list.
2. Generate bill in pdf for user.
3. Track inventory details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review :-

Initially I had decided to add more functionality to the software but due to limited time had to drop them. The functionalities that can be added for future enhancement of the project are :-

1. Generate list of item requirement from inventory details
2. Keep two levels of menu. One for billing department and other for managers. The managers will have extra menus like adding an employee and generating reports.
3. Add employee
4. Generate sales and profit report

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What this project file contains :-

1. Entire project sturcture from netbeans along with source code and jar libraries.
2. Project writeup, presentation, diagrams and MySql workbench model
3. Sql database file for the project that needs to be imported

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run the project :-

1. Import the database file in your MySql
2. Open the connectToDatabase.java source file and change the connection details as per your computer (If not done then it will not get connected to the database and thus the program will show an error).
3. Open the project in any IDE and include the jar files in the libraries section.
4. You can run the project directly, or by making a java executable file for the software.
5. Login id is "Admin" and password is "Password".
